###Description
This repo contains my work for the Coursera course "Getting and Cleaning Data".  This course is part of the Data Science specialization series.

The requirements for this project are found in the description at [https://class.coursera.org/getdata-006/human_grading/view/courses/972584/assessments/3/submissions][1]:

> The purpose of this project is to
> demonstrate your ability to collect,
> work with, and clean a data set. The
> goal is to prepare tidy data that can
> be used for later analysis. You will
> be graded by your peers on a series of
> yes/no questions related to the
> project. You will be required to
> submit: 1) a tidy data set as
> described below, 2) a link to a Github
> repository with your script for
> performing the analysis, and 3) a code
> book that describes the variables, the
> data, and any transformations or work
> that you performed to clean up the
> data called CodeBook.md. You should
> also include a README.md in the repo
> with your scripts. This repo explains
> how all of the scripts work and how
> they are connected.

###Details
Included in this repository are the following items:

 - This Readme.md: a description of the contents of this repo and how to use it. 
 - CodeBook.md: a description of the work done to clean up the data, including descriptions of the variables, as well as a description of the data itself.
 - run_analysis.R: the script file which is used to do the work

###Requirements
To use this project, you will need the dataset from [https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip][2] 

 - Extract the dataset, placing the UCI HAR Dataset folder in your working directory
 - Place the run_analysis.R script from this repo in the same working directory
 - Execute run_analysis.R.
